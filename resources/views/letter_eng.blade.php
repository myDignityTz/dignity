                It was always difficult to climb the mountains at home, on the 
                way to the main road because of the scar that once existed in my heart; 
                it was very hard to breathe whenever I did something tiring.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Last year everything changed when I received a miracle, my scar simply 
                disappeared, now it is one of the happiest moments of my life when I 
                climb that last mountain to the main road, because now I can pant, I 
                can breathe now I feel tired just like everyone else, now the SCAR is gone.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                It is something that gives me so much hope in my life, the doctors said 
                it can’t disappear, but with something as simple as faith it vanished 
                like thin air, anything can change.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                I move forward with sure hope that the lives of girls in Tanzania can be 
                transformed, girls are able to receive so much strength from the love, support 
                and hope that parents have upon them, all this gives rise to friendship and open 
                doors of forming a great relationship, protecting our children so that they 
                can achieve what we hope for, and what they dream of for their future is our duty.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Even though girls’ pregnancy seems as a problem impossible to erase, the power is 
                in our hands, and the truth is the only solution, it is not easy but if a parent 
                has that close relationship, it is never too late, you can start now, if not try to 
                build that relationship, girls can only hear the truth on topics such as relationships 
                and sex from the people willing to tell them the truth, they’ve heard so many lies and 
                blindly engage in sexual activities become pregnant and dropout from school, it is 
                time for parents to open up and communicate with their children.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                You will be amazed by the results that the truth will bring, and we help you deliver 
                just that.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                If a scar could disappear from a heart of one girl, so can it from the hearts of 
                all girls in Tanzania.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                In the future we will have mothers who are doctors, engineers, teachers, accountants... 
                Not those who dropped out of school because they got pregnant.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Join the fight because everything is possible.
            </p>
